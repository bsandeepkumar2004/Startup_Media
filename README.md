#Start Up Media

**Startup Media** is a platform designed to connect early-stage startups with visionary investors. It aims to solve a real-world problem: many brilliant startup ideas go unnoticed due to a lack of exposure, and many investors struggle to find promising, innovative projects.

## Problem Statement

In the current startup ecosystem:
- Founders lack exposure and access to capital.
- Investors lack direct access to unique and vetted startup ideas.
- There is no single transparent, trustworthy bridge connecting both parties.

## Solution

Startup Media provides:
- A media-rich platform for **startup idea promotion**.
- **Direct channels for investors** to explore, filter, and connect with ideas.
- Real-time tracking of **startup pitch submissions**, **investor interest**, and **funding status**.
